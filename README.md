# FAQ

## How to install?

In your command line, type "pip install BMI500caonia"

## How to use

python

from BMI500caonia import BMI500clustering

BMI500clustering.Kmeans_run(n, iteration, random_state)

(n is the number of clusters, iteration is the number of iteration, random_state is the number of random initializations)

## Running time and hardware requirement

The running time is 14 seconds in Titan'x 12 GB gpu and Intel Iris 16 GB cpu. 

## Future work

The function should be modified to be more flexible in the future, so the user can customize parameters.
